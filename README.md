My fork of deepdow developed for my master thesis. The changes can be assessed by the link https://github.com/jankrepl/deepdow/compare/master...dsman1823:deepdowmine:master.

Changes summary:
* Added new NN architectures. The ones, that were proposed in the original repository are not training well (the loss function quickly goes to the plato even on the learning set)
